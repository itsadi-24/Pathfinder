# Pathfinding Visualizer

A visually stunning pathfinding visualization app built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. It allows users to see how different pathfinding algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm work in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualize multiple pathfinding algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Modern, responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS**
- Smooth animations thanks to **Framer Motion**
- Generate mazes and reset paths with ease
- Speed and algorithm control for custom visualizations

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for beautiful transitions

## 📚 Algorithms Implemented

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An efficient algorithm to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
